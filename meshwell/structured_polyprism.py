"""Structured (gmsh-tutorial-t3-style) layered extrusion for ``PolyPrism``.

This module hosts everything that is structured-specific:

* :class:`_StructuredPolyPrism` -- private subclass of ``PolyPrism`` that
  the ``PolyPrism.__new__`` dispatcher returns when the user passes
  ``n_layers=``. Same user-visible class identity (``isinstance(p, PolyPrism)``
  remains true), but with the structured-mode validation rules.
* :class:`Slab` -- one pairwise-disjoint piece of a structured prism after
  the cascade.

Future tasks will add ``expand_slabs_for_entity``, ``resolve_structured_slabs``,
``_StructuredPhantom``, and ``apply_structured_slabs``. They all live in this
module to keep the structured pipeline co-located.

Why a private subclass rather than a flag on ``PolyPrism``: structured-mode
behavior diverges in three places (validation, ``mesh_bool`` semantics,
``instanciate``-time replacement by ``_StructuredPhantom``); a subclass
keeps each branch in one place and lets the rest of meshwell dispatch via
``isinstance``.
