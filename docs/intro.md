### Some more notes about this package and documentation

- Many examples are rendered in the Notebook using Plotly. This is slow for large meshes, in practice the GMSH GUI is preferred.
- The package currently focuses on the automated generation of unstructured triangle and tetrahedral meshes for "complicated" polygon-based geometries. Some planned features include more mesh types (quads, prisms, structured meshes, etc.) and improved parallelism option.
