### Some more notes about this package and documentation

- Many examples are rendered in the Notebook using Matplotlib. For better visualization, in practice the GMSH GUI is preferred.
- The package currently focuses on the automated generation of unstructured triangle and tetrahedral meshes for "complicated" polygon-based geometries. Some planned features include more mesh types (quads, prisms, structured meshes, etc.), improved parallelism option, and more advanced polygon-to-smooth shape processing.
