# GMSH is a powerful meshing engine, but non-standard shapes (e.g. arbitrary polygons) are still most easily described from the bottom-up, by defining vertices, lines, and closed loops.
#
# Meshwell has a "PolySurface" object simplifying this process. It takes as an argument a shapely (Multi)Polygon:

# +

polygon_with_holes = shapely.Polygon(
    [[-2, -2], [3, -2], [3, 2], [-2, 2], [-2, -2]],
)
polygon_with_holes_boolean = shapely.union(
    polygon_with_holes - shapely.Point(-2, -2).buffer(2), shapely.Point(0, 2).buffer(1)
)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot()
plot_polygon(polygon_with_holes_boolean, ax=ax, add_points=False)
plt.show()
# -

# Create the PolySurface:

# +
model = Model()

poly2D = PolySurface(
    polygons=polygon_with_holes_boolean, model=model, physical_name="poly2D"
)
# -

# PolySurfaces (as well as Prisms, and meshwell GMSH_entities) are not added to the CAD model upon definition, so they must be instanciated:

# +
poly2D.instanciate()

model.mesh(entities_list=[poly2D], filename="mesh2D.msh")

# Plotting courtesy of scikit-fem
mesh = from_meshio(meshio.read("mesh2D.msh"))

draw_mesh2d(mesh)
# -

# Although shapely does not work in 3D, it accepts 3D coordinates, which are used here to define surfaces in 3D space.

# ## Some notes
#
# * All polygon verticles are instanciated as 0-D points in the GMSH model
# * All polygon edges (interior and exterior) are instanciated as 1-D lines in the GMSH model
# * "PolySurface" returns the ID(s) of the polygon surfaces, but instanciating the object is enough to add the entity to the GMSH model
# * Ill-formed polygons will cause any meshing to fail
